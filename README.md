**Live Portfolio:** [varunzz.github.io/Portfolio/](https://varunzz.github.io/Portfolio/)

## 👨‍💻 About Me
I am an Electronics and Communication Engineer specializing in C/C++ firmware development and hardware-software integration. With professional experience analyzing commercial fire alarm control networks, I bridge the gap between physical hardware constraints and scalable system logic. I focus on architecting fault-tolerant, multithreaded Industrial IoT edge nodes using FreeRTOS, building thread-safe data pipelines, and deploying asynchronous cloud telemetry.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

* **Firmware & Languages:** C/C++, Python (Core & OOP), JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Memory Management (Pointers/Structs).
* **Embedded & IoT:** FreeRTOS (Task Scheduling, Queues, Mutexes), ESP32, Microcontrollers, MQTT, UART, I2C, Sensor Integration.
* **Tools & Environments:** PlatformIO, VS Code, Wokwi (Hardware-in-the-Loop Simulation), Git, MS Excel.
* **Other Technologies:** Machine Learning (CNN), Computer Vision (OpenCV), Generative AI.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 1. IIoT Safety Controller & Edge Node
Architected a fault-tolerant ESP32 safety controller utilizing FreeRTOS preemptive scheduling to decouple asynchronous MQTT cloud telemetry from time-critical hardware interrupts. Engineered thread-safe data pipelines using RTOS Queues and Mutexes.
* **Tech:** FreeRTOS, C++, ESP32, MQTT, JSON

### 2. Magnetic Field Detector
A portable embedded device designed to measure magnetic fields within a small radius. Utilizes a Hall effect sensor to detect voltage variations, processed via bare-metal C++ on a microcontroller for real-time display.
* **Tech:** C++, Microcontrollers, ADC/Hardware Integration

### 3. Hand Gesture Recognition
A Python-based computer vision application that converts camera input into text or speech. Employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze visual imagery and track hand topography.
* **Tech:** Python, OpenCV, Machine Learning, CNN
